## <span style="color:#ff6600">Planning</span>

Before making any major decisions, we suggest using Figma or a similar tool to create wireframes for your site. These tools make the development process much easier. From our experience, ideas that look good in your head might not work out as well in reality. Wireframing also helps prevent scope creep.

- Figma
- Sketch
- Adobe XD
- Canva

## <span style="color:purple">Frameworks</span>

Before starting a Website Development project, we would recommend you understand what frameworks are and which would be beneficial for you.

**What is a Framework?**
A framework is a structured platform or set of tools and libraries designed to simplify and expedite the development process in various areas, such as software, web applications, or mobile apps. It provides a foundation on which developers can build applications without needing to start from scratch.

### <span style="color:red">Laravel</span>

Laravel is a popular, open-source PHP framework used for web application development. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which helps in organizing and separating the application’s logic, user interface, and data layers. Laravel is known for its elegant syntax, developer-friendly features, and a strong focus on simplicity and readability.

**Use Cases:**

***Web Applications***: Laravel is widely used to build web applications ranging from small websites to complex, large-scale systems.

***APIs***: With Laravel, you can easily build RESTful APIs, making it a popular choice for backend development.

***eCommerce***: Laravel’s robust features make it suitable for developing eCommerce platforms, with built-in support for user management, payment gateways, and more.

### Angular

Angular is a platform and framework for building client-side applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. Developed and maintained by Google, it provides a comprehensive solution for developing robust and scalable single-page applications. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. Examples of applications built with Angular include

- Google AdWords, showcasing Angular's ability to handle complex, large-scale projects.
- parts of Microsoft Office Online for a rich, interactive experience.
- Gmail, which leverages Angular’s capabilities for enhanced performance and user experience.

Angular continues to evolve with regular updates and new features, supported by a strong community and comprehensive documentation, making it a popular choice for modern web development.

### React

React is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook, along with a community of individual developers and companies.

### Electron

Electron is an open-source framework developed by GitHub that allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Essentially, it enables you to create desktop apps with the same technologies you would use for web development. Here are some examples:

- Discord: Initially built as a web application using React, Discord uses Electron to create its desktop application. This allows it to leverage the same codebase for both web and desktop versions, ensuring consistency across platforms.

- Visual Studio Code: Microsoft's popular code editor is another well-known example of an Electron app. It utilizes Electron to provide a consistent development experience across different operating systems.

#### Electron is compatible with

- React
- Angular
- Vue.js
